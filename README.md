# p7
Optimize input as fourier-wavelet with a.e. part and discrete part then apply them into original.

# Description
We bet the using principal axis of viewpoint as continuity concludes Wavelet(Wavelet(Fourier+Discrete)+Discrete)+Discrete can cover any of the f.
So we optimize and use the series of oritinal input to such form then, we apply then into the next steps.
